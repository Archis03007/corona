		<h2>Indiaâ€™s economy downshifts as coronavirus fallout looms</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="data">

		<h4>Mumbai, India - India's economy continues to decelerate, presenting challenges to policymakers tasked with reviving growth as the coronavirus outbreak disrupts global supply chains and saps business and investor confidence around the world.<br><br>

			Figures released on Friday by the National Statistics Office (NSO) showed India's economy grew an anaemic 4.7 percent on an annualised basis in the final three months of 2019 - marking a slowdown from the same period a year earlier, as well as from the previous quarter's revised growth rate of 5.1 percent.<br><br>

			Hopes for a stronger pick up in activity had been fed by the emergence of potential green shoots late last year including increased optimism among auto-dealers, a bellwether of economic health, and a bumper winter crop.<br><br>

			But that was before the spread of coronavirus starting in January. As global recession risks mount with the widening outbreak, and the fallout of COVID-19 becomes clearer, forecasters are revising growth estimates downwards.<br><br>

			"Global growth and trade are weakening and there are certain manufacturing supply chains through which disruptions in Chinese production impact India," Priyanka Kishore, head of India and South-East Asia at Oxford Economics, told Al Jazeera. "We could see slower recovery going forward than people are expecting".<br><br>

			The NSO has pegged 2019-20 growth at 5 percent, representing no change from last month's estimates. Growth in India peaked in 2016 at 8.2 percent, the rate at which India's own finance ministry said it must grow to achieve its goal of becoming a five-trillion-dollar economy in five years.<br><br>

			Now, there are fears that "stagflation" - a term coined to reflect the twin pressures of a stagnant economy and rising consumer prices - is squeezing household incomes in a traditionally consumption-led economy.<br><br>

			India's government has tried to stem the slowdown with a host of measures, including tax cuts and cash injections for the banking and automobile sectors. However, February's budget session left many wanting, as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman failed to announce the spending increases, which analysts said would help spur growth.</h4>
